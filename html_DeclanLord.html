        I am a polite, friendly, and curious individual who enjoys learning and developing new skills. I have
            worked in a role with work experience as well as a temporary role as a domestic assistant. During this
            time I gained valuable skills and qualities, these include: team work, verbal communication, and
            listening. I am very particular and detailed focused, and am also very driven when it comes to doing
            things to be the best of my ability, these are skills and qualities I hope to be able to bring to the
            workplace. My hobbies include: digital art, online gaming, baking, and socialising with family and friends.</div>
